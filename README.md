### Hi 👋🏼 I‘m a software engineer based in Munich, Germany.

In the office I usually find myself driving Architecture Board discussions or chatting with the Principal Engineer about how to help our peers grow 🧑🏻‍💻.

In my free time, I like to listen to and play classical music 🎹, ride my motorcycle to the Alps 🏔️, or play story driven video games 🎮.
